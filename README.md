A public and community-contributed catalog of known strong gravitational lenses. 

![Known Lenses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenscat/lenscat/main/catalog.png)

## Quickstart

The catalog is available as a _plain csv file_ under [lenscat/data/catalog.csv](https://github.com/lenscat/lenscat/blob/main/lenscat/data/catalog.csv). Alternatively, one can interact with the catalog using a [web app](https://lenscat.streamlit.app/) (mobile-friendly).

We also provide a _python package_ `lenscat`, available in pypi. Simply do
```bash
pip install lenscat
```
to install the latest version. Here we adopt the _continuous deployment_ paradigm (similar to [`astroquery`](https://github.com/astropy/astroquery)). Whenever there is a change in the catalog content, or a major change in the code, a new release will be available instantaneously on both [GitHub](https://github.com/lenscat/lenscat/releases) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lenscat/).

The code converts the catalog in the csv file into a custom `Catalog` object that is inherited from the `Table` object in `astropy`. To access the catalog, simply run
```python
In [1]: import lenscat; lenscat.catalog
Out[1]:

```
Note that the code will try to assign the unit for each of the columns inferred from its name, and that it will hide the 'ref' column *by default*. One can show or hide the 'ref' column by calling `.show_ref()` and `.hide_ref()` on the `Catalog` object respectively.

Every `Catalog` object supports two features: basic searching with `.search()` and crossmatching with a skymap with `.crossmatch()`. Note that these function will return a `Catalog` object, and hence *they can be composed together* (e.g., `.crossmatch().search()`).

### Basic searching
This feature is implemented as `.search()`. One can search/filter by any combination of
- ranges of right ascension (specified as `RA_range=(RA_min, RA_max)`)
- ranges of declination (specified as `DEC_range=(DEC_min, DEC_max)`)
- ranges of lens redshift if available (specified as `zlens_range=(zlens_min, zlens_max)`)
- type of the lenses (specified as `lens_type`)
- grading of the lenses (specified as `grading`)

For example, to get a list of the cluster-scale lenses which are confirmed and with a redshift $z_{\mathrm{lens}} \geq 1$ together with the reference, run
```python
In [1]: import lenscat, numpy; lenscat.catalog.search(grading="confirmed", lens_type="cluster", zlens_range=(1,numpy.inf)).show_ref()
Out[1]:
<Catalog length=3>
     name         RA       DEC    zlens   type   grading                                        ref

```

### Crossmatching with a skymap
This feature is implemented as `.crossmatch()`. This function is simply a wrapper to the `crossmatch()` function in `ligo.skymap` which performs the cross-matching of a gravitational-wave (GW) skymap with a given list of coordinates. For example, to cross-match the GW skymap of GW190814 (download from [here](https://gracedb.ligo.org/apiweb/superevents/S190814bv/files/GW190814_PublicationSamples.multiorder.fits)) with only the confirmed lenses in the `lenscat` catalog, simply run
```python
In [1]: import lenscat; lenscat.catalog.search(grading="confirmed").crossmatch("GW190814_PublicationSamples.multiorder.fits")
Out[1]:
<Catalog length=761>
