# $\texttt{lenscat}$

A public and community-maintained catalog of known strong gravitational lenses. 

![Known Lenses](lenscat_galclust.png)

## Quickstart

The catalog is available as a _plain csv file_ under [lenscat/data/catalog.csv](https://github.com/lenscat/lenscat/blob/main/lenscat/data/catalog.csv).

We also provide a _python package_ `lenscat`, available in pypi. Simply do
```bash
pip install lenscat
```
to install the latest version. The code converts the catalog in the csv file into a `Table` object in `astropy`. To access the table, simply run
```python
import lenscat
lenscat.catalog
```
The code also implements `crossmatch()`, a wrapper to the `crossmatch()` function in `ligo.skymap`, to cross-match a gravitational-wave (GW) skymap with the catalog. For example, to cross-match the GW skymap of GW170817 with the catalog, simply run
```python
import lenscat
lenscat.crossmatch("GW170817")
```
where the code will automatically download the skymap from the internet. Refer to the documentation for more details.

## Format

['name'] = Names of galaxies/galaxy clusters \
['RA'] = RA in dergees \
['DEC'] = DEC in degrees \
['zlens'] = Lens redshift (if known) \
['type'] = Type of lens (i.e. galaxy or galaxy cluster) \
['rank'] = Ranking whether it is a confirmed lens or a probable lens (see individual references for internal ranking systems) \
['ref'] = Reference to the corresponding catalogue or study
