# $\texttt{lenscat}$

A public and community-maintained catalog of known strong gravitational lenses. 

![Known Lenses](knownlenses.png)

Structure:

['Name'] = Names of galaxies/galaxy clusters \
['RA'] = RA in dergees \
['DEC'] = DEC in degrees \
['zlens'] = Lens redshift (if known) \
['type'] =  Type of lens (i.e. galaxy or galaxy cluster) \
['rank'] = Ranking whether it is a confirmed lens or a probable lens (see individual references for internal ranking systems).
