A public and community-maintained catalog of known strong gravitational lenses. 

![Known Lenses](lenscat_galclust.png)

## Quickstart

The catalog is available as a _plain csv file_ under [lenscat/data/catalog.csv](https://github.com/lenscat/lenscat/blob/main/lenscat/data/catalog.csv).

We also provide a _python package_ `lenscat`, available in pypi. Simply do
```bash
pip install lenscat
```
to install the latest version. The code converts the catalog in the csv file into a `Table` object in `astropy`. To access the table, simply run
```python
In [1]: import lenscat; lenscat.catalog
Out[1]:
<Table length=1530>

```

The code also implements `crossmatch()`, a wrapper to the `crossmatch()` function in `ligo.skymap`, to cross-match a gravitational-wave (GW) skymap with the catalog. For example, to cross-match the GW skymap of GW170817 with the catalog, simply run
```python
import lenscat
lenscat.crossmatch("GW170817")
```
where the code will automatically download the skymap from the internet. Refer to the documentation for more details.
